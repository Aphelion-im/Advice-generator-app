## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ViteJS

### What I learned
- That Grid is easier than I thought. 
- Found a nice CSS glow generator. See the Useful resources section.
- The Advice slip API

### Continued development
Perhaps, some day I will turn it into a React or Vue project.
